# revenue-predictions-lr
I created a model that could predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside air temperature(degC). In this case, I decided a Linear Regression model might be a good candidate to solve this problem.
Independent variable X: Outside Air Temperature
Dependent variable Y: Overall daily revenue generated in dollars.
