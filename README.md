1- I created the first model to predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside air temperature(deg C). In this case, I decided a Linear Regression model might be a good candidate to solve this problem.

###### Independent variable X: Outside Air Temperature

###### Dependent variable Y: Overall daily revenue generated in dollars
  
2- The second model is based on Linear regression and it will predict, the impact of increasing the vehicle horsepower(HP) on fuel economy(Mileage Per Gallon(MPG).

###### Independent variable X: Vehicle HorsePower

###### Dependent variable Y: Mileage per Gallon(MPG)

3- The third model is based on Polynomial regression. In this case, IÂ´ll predict the employee's salary based on years of experience.

###### Independent variable X: Years of experience

###### Dependent variable Y: Salary per year $

4- The fourth model is based on Polynomial regression. In this case, I'll create a model to estimate the cost of goods sold as they vary the production volume(number of units produced).

###### Independent variable X: Number of units

###### Dependent variable Y: Manufacturing cost

5- The fifth model is based on Multiple linear regression. In this case, I`ll predict the S&P 500 stock based on interest rates and employment numbers

###### Independent variable X: interest rates, employment numbers

###### Dependent variable Y: S&P 500 stock

6- The sixth model is based on Logistic regression. In this case, I'll analyze the customer data to predict which customer clicks on the advertisement.

###### Independent variable X: name, e-mail, country, time on Facebook, estimated salary(derived from other parameters)

###### Dependent variable Y: click(1: customer clicked on Ad, 0: customer did not click on the Ad)
