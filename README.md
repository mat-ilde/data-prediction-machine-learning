1- I created a first model that could predict the daily revenue in dollars based on the outside air temperature(deg C). In this case, I decided a Linear Regression model might be a good candidate to solve this problem.

Independent variable X: Outside Air Temperature

Dependent variable Y: Overall daily revenue generated in dollars
  
2- The second model is based on Linear regression as well, but this one will predict, the impact of increasing the vehicle horsepower(HP) on fuel economy(Mileage Per Gallon(MPG).

Independent variable X: Vehicle HorsePower

Dependent variable Y: Mileage per Gallon(MPG)
